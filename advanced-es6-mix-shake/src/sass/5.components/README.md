# Components

Specific UI components.
This is where majority of our work takes place, and our UI components are
often composed of Objects and Components.
They contain cosmetic CSS, and they can be directly overwritten to fit your
UI Kit style.

All Sass files will begin without an underscore, so don't forget to add each
of them to the libraries yaml file as **component** SMACSS level.
