# Utilities

Utilities and helper classes with ability to override anything which goes
before in the triangle, eg. hide helper class.
They are usually one line of code and have !important to make sure they
override all element styles when used.

All Sass files will begin without an underscore, so don't forget to add each
of them to the libraries yaml file as **theme** SMACSS level.

__Note: Utilities don't related to theming category, but wee need to import
them for the last time!__
